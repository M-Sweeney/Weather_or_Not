## Made by: [Matt Sweeney](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sweeney-matt/)

## Description

Weather Or Not is the app that will review the weather forecast for the day and help you determine weather or not you are prepared!

Weather or not is going to be pulling from a [third-party API](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs) to show the forecast for the day. Based on this forecast it will recommend items from your closet to ensure you are prepared for all weather conditions you may encounter. 

## How to Get Started
