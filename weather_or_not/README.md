## Description

Weather Or Not is the app that acts as a clothing and accessory database that will also review the weather forecast for the day and help you determine weather or not you are prepared!

Weather or not is going to be pulling from a [third-party API](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs) to show the forecast for the day. Based on this forecast it will recommend items from your closet to ensure you are prepared for all weather conditions you may encounter. 

## How to Get Started

- Create a user and log in
- Enter your city
- Review the autofilled items in your closet and make edits where needed.
- review the autofilled activities and make edits where needed.
- review the weather for the day to make sure you are prepared!

## Technologies Used

This site will be built using Django/Python on the backend and React, Javascript and CSS on the frontend. The site will be using the below models and React components. Full CRUD operations (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) will be implemented on at least one model.

I will also be using Flowbite for as a technology I have never used. 


## Models

- User
- Items
- Activities

## Components

- App.js
- Header.jsx
- Main.jsx
- Home.jsx
